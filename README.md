Project 4: Yes, #{Jackson} I work out.
Ruby on Rails

So I've made this new app and it's kind of cool looking. The content is all
getting rendered on the page, I'm feeling really good that I was able to understand ruby on rails enough get something
together. A part of me wanted to spend some more time working on a react app, but ruby was something that presented a
new and slightly different challenge.      
The goal of this project, from a learning perspective, was to create a web
app with the function of processing an input of activity, date, minute, and an optional comment. There would be the
ability to edit and delete these inputs after they are saved to a database. The user can then view a graph of the
overall time spent per day on all activitied, or per individual activiy.      
From the perspective of functionality, the app does exactly that.      
Before starting this project, I wasn't feeling very confident with rails but now I've
developed a better understanding of rails functionality and the model view controller architecture.

Moving forward with this project, I would like to add more specific graphing functionality and style more.
